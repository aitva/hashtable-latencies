# Hashtable latencies

This benchmark measures the latency of a web service that stores a large
(250K item) hashtable, in multiple languages.

Garbage collected languages are of greater interest, and the Swift version
is mostly used as a reference of what would be ideal.

# Rules for implementations.

* Each HTTP request will add one new item (and remove one if count > 250K)
* Each item will be a new 1KB buffer with every byte initialized to a value.
* Programs will listen on port 8080 and respond with status 200, body "OK"

# Structure

* All program directories are listed in programs.txt
* Every directory should contain `build.sh` and `run.sh`
* [wrk2](https://github.com/giltene/wrk2) must be installed and linked in $PATH as `wrk2`

# Tests

* Warmup: 10K req/s are sent for 60s (initial hash table content)
* Test 033: 10K req/s are sent by 33  clients concurrently for 60s
* Test 333: 10K req/s are sent by 333 clients concurrently for 60s

# Output:

* All reports are in `reports` directory.
* Charts from both tests can be generated by using [hdrhistogram](http://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html)

# Current results

# Program notes

* reason - This is OCaml with a new syntax. Follow the [install instructions][rii]
* node - Requires node 6.x (`Buffer.alloc` API)
* haskell - Should build easily if you have [stack][his]
* swift-zewo - You should setup [swiftenv to the right snapshot][swiftenv]

# Conclusions

Want to build low-latency, memory-intensive services in a GCed language? Use
OCaml (or Reason if you prefer the syntax).

# Other things that were attempted to fool the OCaml GC:

* random buffer sizes (only had negligable 20% latency increase, likely due to first-fit allocator taking some more time on average to find a proper free heap segment)
* longer running time (5 minutes): no effect
